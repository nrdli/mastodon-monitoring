Prometheus X Mastodon
=====================

I love mastodon, and I love prometheus. Enclosed are my tiny little programs
that try to make them work together.

They will probably all be written in node.js (6+) with yarn. You can simply run
`yarn` and then `yarn start` to kick them off. You can configure them through a
`.env` file, they will listen on localhost by default, and you should probably
front them with a proxy, or at least a firewall.
